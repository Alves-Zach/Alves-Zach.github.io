### Zachary Alves

I earned a Mechanical Engineering bachelor's degree from Colorado State University in 2022 with a minor in computer science. I worked with Lincoln Electric Automation for a year where I demonstrate system features and effectiveness to customers for six axis robotic welding systems as well as customized robot manipulation programs to provide customers with exceptional system effeciency and weld quality.

I'm currently aiming to expand my knowledge about the software and mechanical aspects of robots via a Master's of Robotics at Northwestern University. Through this program I have been able to utilize cutting edge robotic hardware and software in fields like SLAM and robotic manipulation. I will complete my Master's in December of 2024.
